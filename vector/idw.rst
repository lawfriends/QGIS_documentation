Inverse Distance Weighting
==========================

We can also interpolate a point layer to create a raster layer out of it. One method to do so is the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) 
interpolation technique. To perform IDW interpolation in QGIS we have to rely on the external functionalities provided by GRASS GIS that 
are directly accessible form the Processing Toolbox of QGIS.
The function is called v.surf.idw, and itâ€™s available at *Processing Toolbox->GRASS->Vector(.v\*)*. We can compute a raster by interpolating 
the places layer, using as the interpolation variable the population:

    + Input vector layer: the places layer
    + Attribute table column with values to interpolate: select population
    + Interpolated IDW: the path and the name of the output raster layer. Note that if left empty a temporary layer will be created
